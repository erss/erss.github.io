<p> I'm currently a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University with <a href= "https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/research.html">Dr. Byron Yu</a>, studying dimensionality reduction techniques for analyzing populations of neural activity.</p>
		<p>I did my Ph.D. work at Boston University in the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/neuro/academics/graduate/">Graduate Program for Neuroscience</a>, specializing in 
			<a href ="http://www.bu.edu/neuro/academics/graduate/curriculum/computational-neuroscience/"> computational neuroscience</a>. </p>
	
                <p>My dissertation was on the development of 
			biomarkers and statistical models to understand brain function and dysfunction. In particular, my research has been on childhood 
			epilepsy and Angelman syndrome. I did this work jointly with Drs. Mark Kramer and Uri Eden at Boston University in the <a href = "https://math.bu.edu/people/mak/">Neurodata and Modeling lab</a> 
			and with Dr. Catherine Chu at MGH in the <a href = "https://chulab.mgh.harvard.edu">Chu lab</a>.</p>
