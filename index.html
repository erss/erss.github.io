		<p>I'm a graduate student at Boston University in the Graduation Program for Neuroscience, specializing in 
			<a href ="http://www.bu.edu/neuro/academics/graduate/curriculum/computational-neuroscience/"> computational neuroscience</a>. </p>
	
                <p>My doctoral research is on the development of 
			biomarkers and statistical models to understand brain function and dysfunction. In particular, my research has been on childhood 
			epilepsy and Angelman syndrome. I have been working jointly with Mark Kramer at Boston University in the <a href = "https://math.bu.edu/people/mak/">Neurodata and Modeling lab</a> 
			and with Catherine Chu at MGH in the <a href = "https://chulab.mgh.harvard.edu">Chu lab</a>.</p>
